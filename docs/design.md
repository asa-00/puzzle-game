Description: Adaptive and psychologically-driven puzzle game with dynamic AI adjustments, progression, and a reward system.

🎯 Overview

FractaZen is an adaptive, psychologically-designed puzzle game that combines logic, spatial thinking, and reaction skills to create a unique and addictive experience. AI is used to adjust the difficulty level in real-time based on the player’s performance.

🏆 Goals and Objectives

✅ Create an addictive gaming experience through a reward and progression system.
✅ Use AI to analyze player behavior and adapt the game accordingly.
✅ Design a minimalist, neon-inspired aesthetic.
✅ Create a global leaderboard to increase competitiveness.

🧠 User Experience (UX)

🎮 Start Screen
Minimalist design with a neon theme.
Start button and short instructions to minimize the learning curve.

🏆 Game Interface

Grid-based puzzle where the player matches patterns by clicking.
Neon effects to reward correct moves.
Progressive difficulty with increasing complexity.
Immediate feedback with sound and animation.

🏅 Game Over Screen

Displays final score and allows the player to save their score.
Feedback on player performance.

🌍 Leaderboard

Real-time global ranking with Firebase.
Displays top players and scores.

🎨 Design Principles

Element	Description
Typography	Sans-serif, modern, and clean design.
Colors	Neon theme with dark background.
Effects	Glow effects and smooth transitions with Framer Motion.
Feedback	Immediate visual and sound-based feedback for player actions.
🛠️ Technical Architecture
Frontend:
✅ React – For component-based UI.
✅ TypeScript – Type-safe development.
✅ Framer Motion – For smooth animations and transitions.
✅ SCSS – For modular and reusable styling.

Backend:
✅ Firebase Firestore – For real-time data storage and retrieval.
✅ Firebase Authentication – For user identification and security.

State Management:
✅ React State + Hooks – For managing game state and UI updates.

AI and Logic:
✅ Adaptive AI – Dynamic difficulty scaling based on player performance.
✅ JSON-based patterns – For flexible and adaptable game structure.

🎯 Component Details

1. StartScreen.tsx
➡️ Displays when the game has not yet started.
➡️ Includes a start button and instructions.
➡️ Uses Framer Motion for animations.

2. GameBoard.tsx
➡️ Main component for the game grid.
➡️ Renders grid patterns and handles click interactions.
➡️ Color scheme and animations dynamically adjust based on difficulty.

3. GameOverScreen.tsx
➡️ Displays when the game ends.
➡️ Shows player’s final score and allows saving or restarting.
➡️ Provides feedback based on performance.

4. Leaderboard.tsx
➡️ Fetches and displays data from Firebase.
➡️ Real-time update of scores.

🔥 Game Logic

✅ The game generates a grid based on generateGrid() function.
✅ AI adjusts difficulty based on:

Incorrect clicks
Time between clicks
Level of accuracy

✅ The game ends when the score reaches a certain negative threshold.

🚀 Difficulty Scaling

Level	Grid Size	Error Margin	Bonus Points	AI Adjustment
1	4x4	High	+10	None
2	5x5	Medium	+20	Faster pattern change
3	6x6	Low	+30	Increased reaction speed
4	7x7	Very Low	+40	No error margin
5+	8x8	None	+50	Extreme speed

🏅 Reward System

✅ Score Bonus – After completing multiple levels.
✅ Special Effect – Glow effects for successful moves.
✅ Speed Bonus – Extra points for fast reactions.

🌐 Global Leaderboard

✅ Firebase Firestore – Used for real-time storage.
✅ Ranking Based on Highest Score – Sorted in real time.
✅ Instant Update – No page reload required.
